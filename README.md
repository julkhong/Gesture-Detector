## Gesture-Detector
A simple mobile application for gesture detection.

## Motivation
The motivation is mainly for learning purposes. This includes UI designs, examine the proper use of the RecyclerView and CardViews, observe interaction between room database and application (Entities, Repository, ViewModel and LiveData), learn about Content Provider and Resolver and a few more. 


## Code style
No particular code style. But I do follow indentation code style.
